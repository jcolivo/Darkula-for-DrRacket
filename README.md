# DrRacket-themes
Here are some of my favorite dark themes written for DrRacket.

## Installation
### Preliminaries
1. Copy one of the theme folders above to a location of your choice.
2. Quit DrRacket to ensure no issues are encountered during the package installation process.

### From the command line:
1. From the terminal command prompt, change into the directory of the theme you would like to install.
2. Run the following command:

      ```console
     raco pkg install
      ```
### After installation:
Open DrRacket and select your chosen theme from 'Preferences' in the 'Edit' menu.

## Notes and Credits
- These themes have only been tested in a Windows machine, but they should work in Linux and MacOS as well.
- The Gruvbox theme resembles the one from:

- I slightly modified the Spacemacs Light theme from:
