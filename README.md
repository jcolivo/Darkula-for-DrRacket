# DrRacket-themes
Here are some of my favorite dark themes written for DrRacket.
Please note that the Gruvbox theme resembles the one from:

## Installation
From the command line:
1. Make sure to quit DrRacket to ensure no issues are encountered during the package installation process.
2. From the terminal command prompt, change into the directory of the theme you would like to install.
3. Run the following command:

      ```console
     raco pkg install
      ```
4. Open DrRacket, and select your chosen theme from preferences.

These themes have only been tested in a Windows machine, but they should work in Linux and MacOS as well.
