# DrRacket-themes
Here are some of my favorite dark themes written for DrRacket.

## Installation
From the command line:
1. Quit DrRacket to ensure no issues are encountered during the package installation process.
2. From the terminal command prompt, change into the directory of the theme you would like to install.
3. Run the following command:

      ```console
     raco pkg install
      ```
4. Open DrRacket, and select your chosen theme from preferences.

## Notes and Credits
- These themes have only been tested in a Windows machine, but they should work in Linux and MacOS as well.
- The Gruvbox theme here resembles the one from:
